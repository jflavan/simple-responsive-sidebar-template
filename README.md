# Simple Responsive Sidebar Template
This is a simple HTML5 template complete with a responsive sidebar and content area. It comes ready with jQuery, jQuery UI, Respond.js, Font Awesome and, of course, Bootstrap! Use it as you plesae.


## How to Use
### Option 1
```
git clone https://github.com/jflavan/simple-responsive-sidebar-template.git /your/local/directory
```
### Option 2
Copy and paste the index.html and style.css into a blank HTML page and stylesheet.


## Browser Support
- Mobile browsers are instructed to render the layout using `width=device-width` and `initial-scale=1`
- IE 9 and above are supported by the use of a conditional comment that loads [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) and [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) for support of new HTML5 elements and media queries

##Some Notes
- The conditional comments for IE 9 support, as well as the example script at the `<!-- SCRIPTS -->` section, uses a public CDN for open source libraries, [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com/) that's sponsored by a reputable CDN provider, CloudFlare.
- At the `<!-- SCRIPTS -->` section, the example script is jQuery 2.x, which doesn't support IE 8 and below. This HTML5 template only accomodates IE 9 and above, so this is an appropriate choice over jQuery 1.x.
